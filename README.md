##Integrating APIs in the chatbot to improve performance and add functionality
There were two APIs used the project, Flickr and Wiki.

1) Flickr API
I used the Flickr API, to produce smarter chat bot conversions. The API is being used to fetch specific pictures according to particular keywords from the user. 

2)Wiki API
I used the Wiki API to grab information requested by the user from wikipedia.
